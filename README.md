This is a repository for an Automatic Speech Recognition System designed using Digital Signal Processing techniques in MATLAB. The system is designed to recognize spoken words and phrases and convert them into text. The system uses various DSP techniques such as filtering, feature extraction, and classification to accurately recognize speech.

## Features

- Recognizes spoken words and phrases and converts them into text
- Uses various DSP techniques such as filtering, feature extraction, and classification
- Customizable to recognize specific words and phrases
- Includes a user interface for inputting speech and viewing recognized text

## Requirements

- MATLAB

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository
3. Run the SpeechRecognation.m file

## Usage

1. Open the system in MATLAB
2. Use a microphone to input speech
3. View the recognized text in the user interface

## Customization

The system can be customized to recognize specific words and phrases by modifying the code. Users can modify the feature extraction and classification algorithms to improve recognition accuracy.

## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome. Users can submit bug reports or feature requests through the project's GitHub repository.

## License
